**MLH Network** it's a fellow-exclusive job platform that lets fellows share any opportunities that they may come across. It also helps alumni share new openings in their organization with other fellows. They can also make requests to other fellows who currently work at their target organizations and/or regions. All communication is handled by email, so fellows don't have to keep checking the application for new opportunities that they might be interested in.
